## HDMI

What you need are a Full size HDMI Cable and a HDMI capable monitor.

- The 96Boards specification calls for an HDMI port to be present on the board. The MT6797 doesnâ€™t include a built-in HDMI interface.
- The Helio X20 Development Board deploys the built-in DPI interface as the source for the HDMI output. A peripheral Bridge IC (U6502, MT8193) performs this task and it supports a resolution from 480i to 1080p at 30Hz.
